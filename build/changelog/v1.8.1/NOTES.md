## changelog
- fix export beatmaps function not working
- fix app stuck on loading screen (linux, happened if you try to run osu-stuff without an osu-wine installation)
- small ui improvements (checkboxes, remove confirmation will include 2 checkboxes instead of 2 separate popups)
- now you can maximize the window (fucking finally, looks kinda weird tough)

another smool one (hopefully the last one before v2.0)
